# Bank-Churners-Income-Prediction
This data set from the KAGGLE website which provider of varies datasets. This data set basically belongs to the people who are bank churners.

Here we have 10127 examples and 23 features of the data set. But after cleansing the data we can setup the data set with 7081 examples and 20 features (with response variable).

Here I tried to predict the client income category( more than 60K & less than 60K dollers) with using some different classification machine learning algorithms such as,
 1. K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 
 2. Naive Bayes (NB) 
 3. Decision Tree (DT) 
 4. Random Forest (RF)
